				This Site and the Song is all about inspiring people and giving people hope that someday we will find cures to terrible diseases.
			</p>

			<p>
				At first the song was supposed to be for finding a cure for Juvenile Diabetes for my daughter Sarah who was diagnosed at age 3, but then I soon realized how powerful the song was, and I felt I had to share it with anyone affected by any disease.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am hoping the site will inspire and encourage people to donate to organizations that hit home -that are dedicated to research and finding cures.

				Help find a cure, donate to a charity of your choice dedicated to research and finding a cure.
