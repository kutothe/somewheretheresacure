			This Anthem of Hope - Somewhere Theres a Cure came to me one day in the Spring of 2005 while I was at home singing Karaoke. I was singing the song "Somewhere" from West Side Story when it hit me --that the feelings that Somewhere evoked in me, ran parallel with the feelings I felt about finding a cure for Diabetes for my daughter. Those feeling of  Hope- that Someday we will find a cure. So I quickly ran to my computer and printed out the lyrics to Somewhere and began adapting the lyrics to talk about a cure.  In minutes I had made the changes. My dream for the song is that someday Celine Dion will record it and that the song will sell millions of copies and that all the proceeds will go to organizations that are searching for cures.

			Since that time, every time I hear the song - it is still so powerful to me and think about how it can really touch people and make a difference. I have secured the rights to share my song with you today. Anyone can hear the song for free on my website. I hope you like it.

			Last but not least, the song can be downloaded:
