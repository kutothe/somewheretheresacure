<p>
	Someday, Somewhere<br/>
	We'll find a CURE and start living,<br/>
	We'll find a new way of fighting<br/>
	Somehow.
</p>
<p>
	There's HOPE for us,<br/>
	Someday a CURE will come<br/>
	No more needles and No more pain<br/>
	Waits for us somewhere.
</p>
<p>
	Now's the time for us<br/>
	THE CURE is coming soon<br/>
	Time for research &amp; funding too<br/>
	Time to look, Time to care.
</p>
<p>
	Someday, Someway-<br/>
	We'll find THE CURE and start living<br/>
	We'll find it soon- Keep believing<br/>
	Someday, Someway<br/>
	There's a CURE out there<br/>
	I know we'll find a CURE someday<br/>
	Hold my hand cuz we're half way there<br/>
	Hold my hand and say a prayer
</p>
